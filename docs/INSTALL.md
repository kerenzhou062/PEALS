## Install through PyPI

The easiest way to install PEALS is through PyPI system. Get `pip` if
it's not available in your system.

```bash
pip3 install peals --user

```

## Install from source

There are 2 ways to install PEALS from source.

The 1st way is using `pip` command.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kerenzhou062/PEALS.git

cd PEALS

pip3 install . --user

```

The 2nd way is using `setup.py`.

```bash

cd PEALS

python3 setup.py install --user

```

### PYTHONPATH
To set up your `PYTHONPATH` environment variable, you'll need to add
the value `PREFIX/lib/pythonX.Y/site-packages` to your existing
`PYTHONPATH`. In this value, X.Y stands for the majorâ€“minor version of
Python you are using (such as 3.8; you can find this with
`sys.version[:3]` from a Python command line). `PREFIX` is the install
prefix where you installed PEALS. If you did not specify a prefix on
the command line, PEALS will be installed using Python's sys.prefix
value.

On Linux, using bash, I include the new value in my `PYTHONPATH` by
adding this line to my `~/.bashrc`::

 `$ export
 PYTHONPATH=/home/kzhou/lib/python3.8/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH`
